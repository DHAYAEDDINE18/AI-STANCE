    "summary": "This study explores the linguistic resources Saudi postgraduate EFL students use to express stance in critique essays. A corpus of 78,000 words from 73 essays was analyzed using LancsBox software, following Hyland's (2005) model of stance (boosters, hedges, attitude markers, self-mentions). Findings indicate hedges were most frequent, followed by attitude markers, boosters, and self-mentions. The study recommends explicit instruction to enhance students' stance-taking abilities to meet academic writing standards."

    "start_page": 2,
    "end_page": 2,
    "summary": "The introduction emphasizes the importance of equipping postgraduate students with authorial voice and stance in academic writing, moving beyond mere communication of ideas. It highlights that academic writing is a social act involving writer-reader interaction and constructing professional identity. The study aims to explore stance-taking strategies used by Saudi Applied Linguistics Master's students in critique essays, adopting Hyland's (2005) model focusing on stance and engagement."

    "title": "Review of Related Studies",
    "start_page": 3,
    "end_page": 4,
    "summary": "This section reviews literature on stance, voice, and appraisal in academic discourse, noting the shift towards recognizing objectivity's limitations. It discusses how stance and voice are often used interchangeably but can refer to individualized assessment versus community-oriented identity. The review highlights research on stance in EFL/ESL contexts, pointing out that students often lack explicit instruction in expressing interpersonal aspects and rhetorical skills like stance construction. It also notes a gap in research focusing on stance in early-stage EFL student writers."

    "title": "Research Questions",
    "start_page": 5,
    "end_page": 5,
    "summary": "The study poses two primary research questions: 1. What are the actual linguistic resources Saudi postgraduate students of Applied Linguistics use to express stance in their critique writing? 2. What knowledge do these students possess about linguistic resources for expressing stance? These questions guide the investigation into the practical application and theoretical understanding of stance-taking by the target student group."

    "title": "Research Method",
    "start_page": 6,
    "end_page": 6,
    "summary": "This section details the methodology, including the research sample and data collection tools. The sample comprised MA Applied Linguistics students at a Saudi university, who were tasked with writing critique essays. A corpus of 73 essays (78,000 words) was built for analyzing linguistic resources. To assess students' knowledge of stance components, an open-ended questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of twenty students."

  {
    "title": "Data Analysis",
    "start_page": 7,
    "end_page": 7,
    "summary": "The data analysis involved thematic analysis for the open-ended questionnaire responses to understand students' views and experiences. For the corpus of critique essays, LancsBox software was employed to identify and quantify the frequency of specific linguistic markers expressing stance. This quantitative approach allowed for the examination of word and phrase frequencies and distributions related to stance construction."

  {
    "title": "Hedges",
    "start_page": 8,
    "end_page": 8,
    "summary": "The analysis of hedges revealed that 'general*' and its variants were the most frequently used, followed by 'may/might' and 'should'. Modal verbs constituted a significant portion (65%) of the top ten hedge expressions. The study suggests that while students demonstrate an awareness of hedging, their range of resources is limited, heavily relying on modal verbs. Explicit training is recommended to broaden their use of various hedging strategies."

  {
    "title": "Research Findings and Discussion",
    "start_page": 9,
    "end_page": 9,
    "summary": "This section presents the quantitative findings on the frequency of stance markers used by Saudi postgraduate students, revealing hedges as the most common, followed by attitude markers, boosters, and self-mentions. The discussion interprets these results in light of existing literature, noting the students' significant use of hedges, particularly modal verbs, and their reliance on certain boosters and attitude markers. Examples from the corpus illustrate the application of these linguistic resources in critique writing."
  },
  {
    "title": "Boosters",
    "start_page": 10,
    "end_page": 10,
    "summary": "Boosters were found to be the second most frequent category of stance markers. The intensifier 'very' was the most common booster. The study's findings on booster usage, particularly the higher frequency of hedges compared to boosters among developing writers, contrasted with some previous research. Examples illustrate how boosters are employed to express certainty and commitment in the students' critique essays."
  },
  {
    "title": "Attitude Markers",
    "start_page": 11,
    "end_page": 11,
    "summary": "Attitude markers were found to be used more broadly than hedges and boosters. The most frequent markers included 'important', 'agree', and 'only'. These markers were used to convey the writers' affective attitude and evaluation of the critiqued propositions, clearly indicating their viewpoints. The study notes that these markers help readers understand the authors' positions towards academic texts. This section discusses attitude markers, which are linguistic resources used by writers to convey evaluation and personal attitude towards propositions in a text. It categorizes these markers into those expressing significance, limitations, emotion, and assessment, providing examples from postgraduate EFL students' critique writing."
  },
  {
    "title": "Self-Mention",
    "start_page": 12,
    "end_page": 12,
    "summary": "This section focuses on self-mentions, defined as the use of first-person pronouns and possessive adjectives to introduce propositional, affective, or interpersonal information. It highlights their role in communicating with audiences and constructing authorial identity, noting their frequent use by writers in the corpus and providing illustrative examples."

    "title": "Problems in Presenting Authorial Stance",
    "start_page": 13,
    "end_page": 13,
    "summary": "This section addresses challenges faced by student-writers in articulating authorial stance, noting that their expressions can sometimes deviate from academic writing conventions. It discusses the difficulty in balancing humility and authoritativeness, providing examples of problematic usages and suggesting that inadequate linguistic knowledge can lead to inappropriate degrees of directness or assertiveness."

    "title": "Knowledge about L1 and FL Writing",
    "start_page": 14,
    "end_page": 14,
    "summary": "This section reports on an open-ended questionnaire exploring participants' knowledge of stance markers in their L1 (Arabic) and FL (English). The findings indicate that students' knowledge about boosters, hedging, and attitude markers in both languages is often blurred or inadequate, with some participants lacking explicit knowledge or examples, particularly concerning Arabic academic writing."

  {
    "title": "CONCLUSION",
    "start_page": 15,
    "end_page": 15,
    "summary": "This section concludes the study by summarizing its exploration of how Saudi postgraduate students articulate stance in critique essays. It highlights that students use various stance-taking strategies without explicit training, but their linguistic resources need enhancement to align with expert academic writers' conventions. Recommendations are provided for improving authorial stance instruction in academic writing syllabuses."

It includes a variety of publications related to linguistics, academic writing, stance, evaluation, and corpus analysis, providing authors, titles, publication details, and in some cases, digital object identifiers (DOIs) for further reference. This section appears to be a list of references cited in the academic work. It includes various journal articles and books related to linguistics, TESOL, and academic writing.
